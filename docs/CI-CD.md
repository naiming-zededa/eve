# EVE CI/CD infrastructure

EVE development happens on GitHub and we use GitHub's Actions as the core of our CI/CD infrastructure.
Within GitHub actions we try to do as much as possible with the stock Github ubuntu image
(which as of December, 2020 is `ubuntu-20.04`) VM that gets instantiated from scratch every time
jobs need to run as part of a given action. However, since we also have to produce ARM builds,
we have a hosted runner tagged `ARM64` that we use for subset of the actions. EVE uses a standard
OCI Registry (currently on [Docker HUB](https://hub.docker.com/r/lfedge/eve)) to store all of
its CI/CD build artifacts.

Definitions of EVE CI/CD actions are available under [.github/workflows](../.github/workflows) folder
and they currently include:

* [Publish](https://github.com/lf-edge/eve/actions?query=workflow%3APublish) publishes various EVE build artifacts into an OCI Registry
* [Pulls](https://github.com/lf-edge/eve/actions?query=workflow%3APRs) manages pull requests
* [Apache Yetus](https://github.com/lf-edge/eve/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Apache+Yetus%22) runs static, lint-like [Apache Yetus](http://yetus.apache.org/) checks on EVE
* [Eden](https://github.com/lf-edge/eve/actions?query=workflow%3AEden) runs integration tests from EVE's sister project [Eden](https://github.com/lf-edge/eden)

Since EVE community generally frowns on branch-heavy development most of the descriptions below
will only apply to the master branch (unless stated otherwise).

## Publish

This is the only action that uses both x86 and ARM64 runners. It gets triggered on either updates
to the `master` branch or creation of release tags. Publish produces a set of tagged artifacts and
pushes them into EVE's OCI Registry repositories. Logic responsible for figuring out correct tags
for these artifacts resides in EVE's top-level Makefile and can be summarized as:

* If Publish gets triggered on a release tag (release tags are the ones with `x.y.z` names) that
  compares as greater than all the other release tags currently present in a repo that release tag
  is considered to be the latest. All artifacts originating from the Publish triggered on the latest
  tag get matching `x.y.z` OCI registry tags AND get an additional symbolic tag `latest`. Since
  the artifacts are typically retrieved with a `docker pull lfedge/eve-XXX` this policy corresponds
  well with the expectation that such a pull is expected to retrieve `lfedge/eve-XXX:latest` even
  though it is a mere alias for `lfedge/eve-XXX:x.y.z`. Another crucial distinction of a Publish
  action triggered on the latest tag is that it gets the benefit of a full (from scratch) build
  as opposed to using pre-cached artifacts. This is done to ensure that EVE builds can be rebuilt
  in the future in a self-contained manner but it does, of course, increase the build time dramatically.
* If Publish gets triggered on a release tag that is NOT considered to be the `latest` (for example when
  building .z patch releases for older x.y.(z-1) releases) the OCI registry artifacts only get a matching
  `x.y.z` tag and no additional aliases are generated. The build is also typically much faster since it
  uses pre-cached artifacts in OCI registry if the corresponding source package in the EVE tree didn't
  change. Note, however, that building a patch release for the previous latest tag becomes a new latest
  tag and thus subject to the latest tag treatment (e.g. `x.y.z` being latest means `x.y.(z+1)` will now
  compare as greater than any other tag since it is greater than `x.y.z` itself).
* If Publish gets triggered on a push to the `master` branch (e.g. after PR merge) all EVE packages
  in an OCI registry get two tags assigned:
    1. symbolic tag `snapshot` (to facilitate `docker pull lfedge/eve-pillar:snapshot` type of usage)
    2. source-derived unique tag
  Source-derived unique tag is expected to be a SHA-like ID that changes only when any part of the
  source tree corresponding to the EVE packages changes and thus allows for lazy (CAS-like) caching
  of build updates. For all packages with actual source code this is linuxkit generated git tree sha
  (e.g. `lfedge/eve-pillar:b8c0b1813a7819ee9eefdc77f1883da5613e7017`). For rootfs and its package this
  is a synthetic version ID generated by the makefile of the form `0.0.0-master-<git sha>`.
* If Publish gets triggered on any other branch (although this is rare and is not supported by default
  in our Publish action) the Makefile logic will be identical to what's happening with a master branch
  with the only two exceptions being around the name of the symbolic tag. Instead of a `snapshot` it
  will be either:
    1. `x.y.z-<# commits on top>-<git sha>` (e.g. `5.15.1-6-g6658d671f`) for branches that can be
        traced back to a git tag
    2. `branch name` (e.g. `foo`) for branches that do NOT contain a single git tag in their history

## Pulls

Pulls is, effectively, a much more constrained version of the Publish action. The reason it needs
to be constrained is that it triggers on any pull request submitted to the master branch and that
may include anonymous pull requests containing malicious code in them. Builds triggered by this
action do NOT deposit artifacts into the regular OCI registry. The registry that is being used
is a quarantined one over at `evebuild/danger` and the only artifact that is ever being deposited
there is a rootfs container tagged as `pr-ID` (e.g. `docker pull evebuild/danger:pr-12345` will
fetch a rootfs container for Pull Request 12345).

For the same reasons, Pulls action only runs on x86 runner since even GitHub itself strongly
discourages running anything that gets triggered by pull requests on hosted runners (which
is what our ARM64 runner is). This, in turn, may result in pull requests that end up breaking
our ARM buils but that seems to be rare enough of an event for now.

## Apache Yetus and Eden

These two actions run on x86 runner only. Yetus doesn't need to have an ARM64 run and Eden
would've benefited from one, but the underlying infrastructure required for that is still
too heavy to be hooked up to the GitHub actions (and it can't even be a hosted runner because
of the security concerns).

Both of these actions get triggered on PRs submitted to the master (and no other!) branch and
in addition Eden also gets triggered on updates to the master branch itself. We do NOT run
either of these on tags (releases).

In order to avoid lengthy rebuilds of EVE's rootfs, Eden action checks for `evebuild/danger:pr-12345`
artifacts and if one is available it uses it. If not it rebuilds it from scratch and then uses the
local build.

It may be marginally useful to run Yetus on updates to the master itself, but Yetus in its full
glory will generate too much feedback and the incremental updates are already covered by Yetus
triggering on pull request submissions.
